Generating Payloads
===================

Payloads may be generated via the ``Payloads`` menu.  Payloads are tied to handlers, so you need at least 1 handler to generate a payload.
Simply select the desired handler and payload format, then click ``Download``.  The payloads are automatically dropped to your user's downloads folder.
