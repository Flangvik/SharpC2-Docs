Generating Payloads
===================

Payloads may be generated via the ``Payloads`` menu.  Payloads are tied to handlers, so you need at least one handler to generate a payload.
First, select the desired handler and payload format.

Hosting
-------

Clicking the ``Host`` button will open a new dialogue window for hosting the file on an HTTP handler.  Select the desired handler and enter a URI.

.. note::
    The HTTP handler must already exist.

Thereafter, the payload will appear in the hosted files table within the ``Handler`` menu.  It can be removed by clicking the red garbage icon.
